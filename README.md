# Voodies – UX Research Case Study
*A social food discovery app for creators, explorers, and casual diners.*

---

## Background

**Voodies** is a mobile-first platform designed to help users discover local restaurants through short-form food videos. Think TikTok meets Yelp.

Our team was preparing for a public launch, and I joined during the multi-phase beta testing to ensure we understood user behaviors, pain points, and opportunities for product improvement.

---

## The Challenge

We needed to:
- Validate core features (Discovery, Profile, Upload)
- Improve usability and reduce friction
- Understand how different types of users experience the app
- Prioritize features that increase engagement and retention

---

##  My Role

As a UX Researcher, I:
- Conducted 8 moderated usability interviews
- Designed survey and testing scripts for 3 beta waves (25 → 30 → 50 testers)
- Synthesized data into user personas and prioritized feature requests
- Shared findings with Product, Design, and Eng during weekly XFN presentations

##  Research Process

### Methods
-  **Usability Testing:** Think-aloud tasks on the Discovery and Profile flows
-  **User Interviews:** Conducted over Zoom with beta testers
-  **Weekly Surveys:** Measured evolving sentiment and pain points
-  **Persona Building:** Based on real user behaviors and needs from interviews and surveys

## Who We Designed For

Through our research, we developed 6 distinct user personas:

| Persona | Core Need |
|--------|-----------|
| **Food Explorers** | Want authentic, nearby, high-quality options |
| **Content Creators** | Need tools to tag, post, and grow |
| **Social Diners** | Plan outings and need ambiance info |
| **Scrollers** | Browse passively, want TikTok-style flow |
| **Meal Preppers** | Save for later, sort by occasion |
| **College Students** | Affordable, trendy, group-friendly spots |

---

## Key Findings

| Area | Insight |
|------|--------|
|  **Discovery** | Users preferred a map-first UI and strong filters (cuisine, trending) |
|  **Profile** | Users wanted editable bios, links, and profile pics |
|  **Content Creation** | Creators needed in-app video tools and tagging |
|  **Navigation** | Familiarity with TikTok UX increased ease and trust |
|  **Technical** | Scrolling lag, location mismatches, and video bugs hurt usability |

> “I just want to click a restaurant name and get *everything* in one place.”

## Outcomes & Impact

## Reflection

This project gave me hands-on experience running mixed-methods research in an iterative, agile environment. I learned to:
- Balance stakeholder goals with user needs
- Prioritize insights into actionable next steps
- Communicate findings clearly and cross-functionally
