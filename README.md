# Voodies – UX Research Case Study
*A social food discovery app for creators, explorers, and casual diners.*

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Voodies** is a mobile-first social platform that helps users discover and share restaurant experiences through short-form videos. Think Yelp meets TikTok, reimagined for foodies.

As a UX Research Intern on the Voodies product team, I led research during a multi-phase beta launch to uncover usability pain points, identify user needs, and inform product decisions. I conducted interviews, designed surveys, and synthesized insights across three waves of beta testing.
